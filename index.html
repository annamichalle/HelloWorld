    <h1> This is my transcription of an excerpt from William Knox's Tract the Second pages 18-19</h1>
   If however on the <br>
   other hand the purchasing Negroes for slaves <br>
   be consistent with divine and human obliga- <br>
   tions, care should be taken to secure the pro- <br>
   perty of the slave to his owner under all circum- <br>
   stances; and such a plan of instruction should <br>
   be digested, as might best conduce the Ne-<br>
   groes eternal welfare, without making them <br>
   uneasy in their present condition, or encoura- <br>
   ing them to revolt against their owners. As <br>
   the first thing to be done therefore is to deter- <br>
   mine the lawfulness of purchasing Negroes for <br>
   slaves, it may be proper to state the fact fully, <br>
   that those whose high office it is to expound <br>
   the divine will as far as it has been revealed, <br>
   may be better able to judge of the confor- <br>
   mity or repugance of this transaction to it. <br>
